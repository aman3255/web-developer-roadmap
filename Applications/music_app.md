# üéµ Music App

## Description

This project aims to build a music app that allows both **Admin** and **End-users** to manage and interact with music data. The app will include functionality for users to register and log in, manage music content such as artists, albums, tracks, and playlists, and implement a favorites system. The backend is built using **Golang**, **Gin framework**, and **MySQL**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- **Gin framework** for fast and efficient web routing
- **SQLx** or **Gorm** for ORM and database interaction
- **JWT** for secure user authentication and authorization
- **MySQL** for relational database management

---

## üë• Users

The application supports two types of users:

- **Admin**: Full access to all features, including the ability to modify content.
- **User**: Limited to viewing content but can favorite or unfavorite tracks.

> **Note:** Admin users are essentially users too. They can access all functionalities of a regular user but with additional permissions to manage content.
